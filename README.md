# Metaheuristic_optimisation

This project demonstrates the implementation of the following algorithms used for solving Boolean Satisfiability problems(SAT) and Travelling salesman problems(TSP):

1. GSAT with Tabu list
2. Novelty Plus
3. TSP problem solved using Local search with pertubation phase.
